## CycleGAN-Driven Data Augmentation for Improved Neural Network Disease Detection 


Please find and download the BRACS Dataset from here: https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/ 

After downloading, please open the SVS files and their corresponding .qpdata annotations using the QuPath software, which you can install from here: https://qupath.github.io/

Then, under the File tab, choose the Export objects as GeoJSON feature and select the Export as FeatureCollection option to create a .geojson file that you can use to create binary masks. Training our CycleGAN requires both an RGB image and a grayscale binary mask.

Also, since each SVS image is too large to process at once, we have extracted patches from each image and its corresponding binary mask (1024*1024) for training. 

This repository contains scripts to help you:

1. Generate binary masks from SVS images guided by coordinates in the .geojson file

2. Extract 1024*1024 .png patches from SVS images + TIFF binary masks (class: with lesions) guided by coordinates in the .geojson file

3. Extract 1024*1024 .png patches from SVS images (class: without lesions) with randomness conditionally applied to avoid extracting too many patches

4. Train a CycleGAN model to synthesize pathology onto healthy images with binary masks as conditional input

5. Evaluate the CycleGAN model using IoU and SSIM metrics 

6. Train a CycleGAN model to synthesize pathology onto healthy images without any conditional input

7. Add synthetic images (created from 1. a CycleGAN trained with binary masks, 2. a CycleGAN trained with no conditional input) to the original training dataset for a classification task to evaluate whether fake images improve a neural network model's generalization abilities 

8. Train 4 independent sets of models and measure the sensitivity of models trained with real data only, synthetic data only, real + synthetic data for fake images created from a CycleGAN trained with binary masks, and real + synthetic data for fake images created from a CycleGAN trained without binary masks
